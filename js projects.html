      <li>Project-1 (Simple Calculator (Version-1)) Using Vanilla HTML, CSS & javaScript</li>
    </h2>
    <p>Simple calculator version-1 is my very first project of javaScript. In this project <br> I have used HTML,
      CSS(grid property) and some amazing concept of javaScript like <br>"Eventlisteners" and "Eval Method" while
      creating. You can perform any arithmetic <br> operation by using this calculator easily.

    <h3>Workflow</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Created basic structure using HTML</li>
      <li>Added CSS styles to make it attractive & responsive </li>
      <li>Added JS concept like "Eventlisteners" & "Eval Method" for actual working</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      <li>Project-2 (Rock, Papper & Scissor Game) Using Vanilla HTML, CSS javaScript </li>
    </h2>
    <p>I have created the digitalized version of rock, paper & scissors game where <br> the computer will play this game
      with you. In this project I have used the <br>modular way of programming(used functions for every task that has to
      be done).<br> I have also used some in-build methods of javaScript like "math.random" & "math.round"<br> to
      generate the computer choice.

    <h2>
      <li>Project-3 (Tic-Tac-Toe Game) Using Vanilla HTML, CSS & JS </li>
    </h2>
    <p>Tic-Tac-Toe game is also a digitalized version of the game that we were often used to play <br>  at our school time commonly known as (Zero-Kanta). This game is basically a two player <br>  game where both players have to play their move till winning condition.While creating this <br>game I have used the concept of two dimensional arrays for matching the patterns of the moves  <br> played   by the players.  
    <ul>
      <li>Created basic structure of the game using HTML</li>
      <li>Added CSS styles to make it attractive & responsive </li>
      <li>Added JS concept like "2D arrays" & "if-else conditionals" for its actual working.</li>
    </ul>
